# CodeDay 2014 Wix Lounge
When? November 8-9, noon-noon<br/>
Where? The Wix Lounge<br/>
Why? So we can show everyone our idea

#Miso Hungry (Website)

### Design
Website is targeted mainly for people that need ideas on what to eat. People can choose to have a random food, drink, or dessert show up by just clicking a button. Depending on what the person chooses, the recipe for that specific choice will pop out along with a short description. The website has a user-friendly interface and most people will get outrageous outcomes.
